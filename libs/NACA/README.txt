# Summary

Are you playing around with airfoils? Better have a fast airfoil data generator at hand. I found some code doing airfoils in this forum, but that wasn't flexible enough as it didn't take advantage of the new vector features of OpenSCAD 2015.   
So I coded my own little library to always have a fully customizable 4 digit NACA airfoil data generator at hand.   
###What you get  
- a fully parametric library  
- a bunch of usage examples  
- help functionality  
- well documented code (but very tough in the core part)  

In my next post I'll show how to do objects that sweep smoothly between different airfoil types being freely shifted and rotated in 3D space. Stay tuned.
